1. describe your favorite editor and explain two outstanding reasons why it is in your favor.
My favorite Editor is sublime text because it has a very clean user interface. My two outstanding reasons of why I love this 
editor is because the editor has multiple languages that can be implimented. Also, the fact that the Editor has the selection
tab that makes it easy to add and remove lines compared to the VM.
